Correlation between variables and the applications of the Magnus Effect
by Irene W, Raymond Duong, Sean Cheong

Abstract:
Interactive resources to test the expected trajectory of a spinning object can be quite hard to come by. Factors such as the air density, launch speed, and even the objectâ€™s diameter play an impactful role in determining the trajectory of a spinning object flying through the air. Our solution to this is an interactive visualization that will allow users to input several different variables and compare trajectories based on their entries. The goal is to illustrate how each variable is connected with one another and visually explain the Magnus Effect in a simple and easy-to-digest manner.
